## Features

- **Unified Approach**: Combines vision, language, and action in a single framework.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to customize and extend for specific use cases.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the interaction with complex models.

## Installation

To install UniVLA, clone the repository and install the required packages. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlavVra48/UniVLA.git
cd UniVLA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using UniVLA for your projects. Below is a simple example of how to load the model and make predictions.

```python
from univla import UniVLA

model = UniVLA.load_model('path/to/model')
output = model.predict(input_data)
print(output)
```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Model Architecture

UniVLA employs a transformer-based architecture that processes input from multiple modalities. The model consists of:

- **Vision Encoder**: Extracts features from images.
- **Language Encoder**: Processes text inputs.
- **Action Decoder**: Generates actions based on the encoded features.

## Datasets

UniVLA supports various datasets for training and evaluation. Some popular datasets include:

- **Image-Text Pairs**: For vision-language tasks.
- **Action Datasets**: For training action prediction models.

You can find the datasets in the `data` folder or download them from the respective sources.

## Training

To train the model, you can use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 50
```

Make sure to adjust the parameters according to your requirements. Check the `train.py` file for more options.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model --dataset path/to/evaluation_dataset
```

This will provide metrics to assess the model's accuracy and efficiency.
